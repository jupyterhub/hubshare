# Specification of hubshare REST API

## Directories

This part of the REST API contains calls for working with directories.
Conceptually, a directory has the following properties:

* Is a zipped directory of contents.
* Has an owner.
* Can be copied by other users, which creates a new directory entry
  with a `parent` field.
* Has a `SHA` that labels the version of the directory.
* Has a list of other user that can upload (`writers`) and downloads
  (`readers`) the directory.
* Has list of users than are administrators (`admins`) of the directory.
  These users can add/remove readers, writers and admins.
